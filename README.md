## Corpus Linguistics - Study 1 - GELC

- Lexical Multi-Dimensional Analysis

### Phase 1

Aimed at validating the current software baseline.

- Using the original `tweets/tagged.txt`

Findings:

- `tokens.txt` and `tokens_ori.txt` are identical;
- `types.txt` and `types.txt` are similar - the order of types vary in some of the lines;
- `selectedvars` and `selectedvars_ori` are similar - there are changes in the order of variables but the variables themselves remain the same;


### Phase 2

Introduces variation due to the tagging process.

- Using the original `tweets/emoji.txt` renamed to `tweets/tweets.txt`
